* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 300x300 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
